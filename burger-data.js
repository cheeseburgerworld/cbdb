        location: "Portland, OR",
        rating: 9,
        style: "Classic",
        notes: "Killer Burger offers nine signature burgers in three sizes: pint, original, or double. Personally, I think the pint size is perfect with the fries, but you do you. Every burger comes with a 1/3 lb \"100% beef\" patty (whatever that means) and bacon by default. Fries are included in the price and they're surprisingly good, making Killer Burger a solid choice for value & a consistently good burger. They've expanded to 24 locations, with the OG spot in NE Hollywood.",

        style: "Pub",
        notes: "This has been one of my fav burgers for years, the ratios & deliciousness of the components are on point. The sides are all delicious. The only downside is now everyone knows about this place and it's loud as fuck inside.",

        notes: "A solid fast food option when on a road trip or anywhere outside of Portland. Pricier than other fast food chains, but the quality justifies it.",

        notes: "Classic drive-in fare. The burger-to-bun ratio isn't great but you're not here just for the burger, you're here for the overall experience and it works.",
