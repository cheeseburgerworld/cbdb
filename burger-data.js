        price: "$$",
        style: "Classic",
        notes: "Killer Burger offers nine signature burgers in three sizes: pint, original, or double. Personally, I think the pint size is perfect with the fries, but you do you. Every burger comes with bacon and fries included in the price, making Killer Burger a solid choice for value.",

        style: "Smash",
        notes: "This has been one of my fav burgers for years, the ratios & deliciousness of the components are on point. The sides are all delicious. The only downside is now everyone knows about this place and it can be painfully loud inside.",

        notes: "A solid fast food option when on a road trip or anywhere outside of Portland. Pricier than other fast food chains, but the quality justifies it.",

        notes: "Delicious smash burger under the Hawthorne Bridge. Juicy patty with a nice sauce, pickles, and caramelized onions. Sides are solid and the value is great, but you might want to pay extra for some lettuce.",

        notes: "A homemade Big Mac dupe for Burger Week 2025, served in a cute little box for an extra touch. Two juicy beef patties, American cheese, River Pig sauce, shredded lettuce, and pickles. The middle bun is a bit thick, but the patties, sauce, and toppings easily beat McDonald's.",

        notes: "I don't know what's up with the Burger King at the Las Vegas Airport, but this thing looked and felt like a cheeseburger but somehow tasted like nothing. My brain refused to register it as food. Weird experience and I'm officially swearing off BK forever.",
