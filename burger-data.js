        rating: 9,
        style: "Classic",
        notes: "Killer Burger offers nine signature burgers in three sizes: pint, original, or double. Personally, I think the pint size is perfect with the fries, but you do you. Every burger comes with bacon and fries included in the price, making Killer Burger a solid choice for value.,

        style: "Smash",
        notes: "This has been one of my fav burgers for years, the ratios & deliciousness of the components are on point. The sides are all delicious. The only downside is now everyone knows about this place and it can be painfully loud inside.",
